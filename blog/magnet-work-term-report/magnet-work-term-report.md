# Working at Magnet Forensics
In this post I will be discussing my recent 4-month work term as a **Software Developer Co-op** at [Magnet Forensics](https://www.magnetforensics.com). I'm a computer science major (Bachlor of Computing) going into my fourth year of school at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca). This was my third work term so far, my first [two terms being spent at MappedIn](https://kanoa.tech/blog/mappedin-work-term-report). I hope that this post may provide some insight into my experience at Magnet and maybe even teach you something new!

# About Magnet
Magnet Forensics is a global leader in digital forensics technology. We design and build products used for digital investigations in the modern era by law enforcement, corporations, and government agencies. Our primary focus is on acquiring and processing digital data from smart phones, computers, and the cloud while modernizing digital evidence mangement. Our goal is to bring the trurth to light and our motto is **Seek Justice. Protect the Innocent.**

> Magnet believes that nothing should stand in the way of the truth.

Magnet is a mid-sized company head quartered in Waterloo near the local university. A large portion of the employees work in Waterloo, but we also have offices in Ottawa, the Netherlands, and the USA. Our most well-known product is Magnet AXIOM, a software based data recovery and examination suite for mobile phones, computers, and cloud data. Magnet also builds products designed for agency wide case mangement geared towards law enforcement.

# Learning Goals
Soon after I started my term at Magnet, I set out to achieve a set of goals that I knew I could work towards during my entire term. I choose three goals that I believed would be important and provide many learning opportunities while I was working at Magnet.

One key point I had in mind when choosing my own learning goals was what Magnet could provide me. I wanted to learn about how our software is used so I could become a more well-rounded developer. That is why I choose that as the focus of two of my goals.

### 1. Understanding the role of digital forensics during an investigation.
// TODO: Clean up

I want to understand the criminal investigation and examination process, and in particular the role of forensics during an investigation.

To achieve this goal, I will seek out individuals who work in the field and shadow as many opportunities as possible.

I can base my progress (and hopefully success) of this goal upon my own understanding of the investigation process. I will have succeeded if I have a basic but complete understanding of the investigation process.

### 2. Becoming competent at back-end development in Clojure.
// TODO: Clean up

I want to improve my skills in full-stack software development involving ECMAScript and Clojure.

I will continuously seek criticism involving my work as well as taking advantage of company resources and experienced co-workers.

Since this goal revolves around general improvement, I can say that if my skills are better than they were when I started, I have achieved my goal.

### 3. Ability to perform a digital forensics search.
// TODO: Clean up

I want to be able to conduct a digital forensics examination of my own without the use of advanced forensic tools.

I will take advantage of all the company resources as well as practice digital forensics with and without the use of tools throughout my work-term.

I should be able to successfully acquire and analysis a mobile and computer system.

# My Job at Magnet
I worked at Magnet as a **Software Developer Co-op**. During my term I spent the majority of my time working on the **D**igital **E**vidence **M**angement (or DEM for short) team. I worked as a full-stack developer with my primary focus being [Magnet AUTOMATE](https://www.magnetforensics.com/products/magnet-automate/), a workflow orchestration product designed to reduce case back log for law enforcement.

While working as a developer at Magnet, my responbilities included maintaining existing software, implementing new features, and ensuring the quality of our software. I developed in multiple environments including front-end web applications, distributed backend servers, and high-performance processing applications. The key languages I worked in were **JavaScript**, **Clojure**, and **C#**. I did the majority of my front-end work in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using modern ES9 code features on a custom API built by Magnet. The other half of my work resolved around back-end programming in [Clojure](https://clojure.org) and managing complex distributed Jenkins pipelines.

Luckily for me, this job provided a diverse set of new and known technologies. I found this perfect because it allowed me to continue working towards an expert skillset within JavaScript and React that I enjoyed using during previous projects (`CIS*3750`) and jobs (MappedIn and Zeitspace). As well, I had to learn Clojure and hence Lisp languages without any prior experience. Finally, this was an amazing experience with regards to learning how distributed pipelines are designed and built primarly in Jenkins.

# Kudos
As a final note, I want to give my kudos to some of the people who helped me throughout my term and provided support. They were much deserve some acknowledgement.

To start, I want to give a huge thanks to both Qiuchen Dong (or just Q) and William Lindsay. Q was my new hire "buddy" during my term at Magnet and helped me out with all the questions that I didn't know who to ask. He also worked with me through one-on-one meetings weekly providing feedback and support. Without Q's help, there's no way I could have achieved as much as I did at Magnet. Additionally, throughout my term, Will was the go to guy for knowledge and help. Since Will was the developer with the most experience on our product on our team, he was indispensible countless times and helped me a ton! Huge kudos to both Q and Will!

Following up, I owe much thanks to both Jason Wood and Kellen Bailey, who both acted as my supervisors, just at different points in time. When I started at Magnet, Jason was my direct supervisor and helped introduce to our team and dynamics as well as helped in setting personal goals for the term. About halfway through my term, Kellen joined Magnet as my new supervisor. Despite being so new to the company, Kellen was able to help me continue my professional development at Magnet and was a wonderful supervisor. I want to thank Jason for being incredibly easy to work with and supportive throughout my term. As well, I want to thank Kellen for instantly being a supervisor who I could go to for any questions at all!
